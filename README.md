# DuboZero

> "Dubo Components" are lightweight, targeted c++ libraries meant for QT applications.
> They aim at providing *simple to use* interfaces for a range of functionality
(notification, crash reporting, zero conf, application update, torrent, etc).
> Fully scriptable, they are primarily meant for javascript (from a QWebEngine) - thought they are usable as well in plain QT.
> Put together, these components should provide a comprehensive foundation for these building a "WebRunner", similarly to Electron.

DuboZero is a (tentatively) cross-platform notification library.

macOS only for now.

Licensed under BSD2.

## How to use

1. Build the library (static by default, see project.pri to change it to a shared library if you need)
2. Link it into your app
```
LIBS += -ldubozero
# If linking statically
DEFINES += LIBDUBOZERO_USE_STATIC
```
3. Use it
```
DuboZero::Notifier * n = new DuboZero::Notifier(parentObject);
DuboZero::Notification * notif = new DuboZero::Notification(n);
notif->Title = "foo";
n->dispatch(notif);
```

For more, see main.cpp in the demo repository.

## Gotchas

1. In order for "actions" to work on notifications, you need to:

    * code-sign your application
    * set NSUserNotificationAlertStyle to "alert" in your application plist

Alternatively, you can manually change the notifications preferences for your application to "alert" in system preferences

    * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11676017/nsusernotification-not-showing-action-button

2. We do use and expose one private API: _alwaysShowAlternateActionMenu. It allows for AdditionalActions to be more "visible".
